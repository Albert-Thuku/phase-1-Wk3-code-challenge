## Project Description
Flatdango web application is a website that enables users to purchase tickets for movies showing at Flatiron Movie Theater. When the website is loaded, the first movie's details is displayed as well as a list of the available showings. 

To view a movie's details, a user clicks the movie's title from the Today's showings list, The movie's details will all be displayed above.

To buy a ticket, the user clicks the 'Buy ticket' button that causes the number of available tickets to decrease. Once the number of tickets sold is equal to the total capacity for the movie, the button disappears and the message "Tickets are sold out" is displayed.

## SetUp Instruction
You will need Visual Studio Code to run this program by using the live preview feature.
